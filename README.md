# hello-world

Hello fellow homo-sapiens or robots!

Constanteof09 delving into Github for the first time. All about electronics, computer science, games, art and robotics.
Sadly a jack of all trades. But maybe a way will be found where most or all of these can be meshed together. 
A Hobbyist at heart. Love programming lanugages especially, Javascript, Java and C++.
But a noob in all of these, since just starting to do more than perceived possible in own ability.
Everyday is a new discovery. So got to keep on learning!
